Term Source Version																							
Term Source Description	A structured classification of molecular entities of biological interest focusing on 'small' chemical compounds.	CHMO, the chemical methods ontology, describes methods used to collect data in chemical experiments, such as mass spectrometry and electron microscopy prepare and separate material for further analysis, such as sample ionisation, chromatography, and electrophoresis synthesise materials, such as epitaxy and continuous vapour deposition It also describes the instruments used in these experiments, such as mass spectrometers and chromatography columns. It is intended to be complementary to the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI).	The COVID-19 Vocabulary (COVoc) is an ontology containing terms related to the research of the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes host organisms, pathogenicity, gene and gene products, barrier gestures, treatments and more.	A classification of the diverse roles performed in the work leading to a published research output in the sciences. Its purpose to provide transparency in contributions to scholarly published work, to enable improved systems of attribution, credit, and accountability.	Bioinformatics operations, data types, formats, identifiers and topics	The Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) provides a systematic description of many experimental variables available in EBI databases, and for external projects such as the NHGRI GWAS catalogue. It combines parts of several biological ontologies, such as anatomy, disease and chemical compounds. The scope of EFO is to support the annotation, analysis and visualization of data handled by many groups at the EBI and as the core ontology for OpenTargets.org	ExO is intended to bridge the gap between exposure science and diverse environmental health disciplines including toxicology, epidemiology, disease surveillance, and epigenetics.	An ontology to represent genomics cohort attributes.	GSSO is the Gender, Sex, and Sex Orientation ontology, including terms related to gender identity and expression, sexual and romantic identity and orientation, and sexual and reproductive behavior.	The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a standardized vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities and clinical features encountered in human disease.	A structured controlled vocabulary for the annotation of experiments concerned with protein-protein interactions.	A structured controlled vocabulary for the annotation of experiments concerned with proteomics mass spectrometry.	MSIO aims to provide a single point of entry to support semantic markup of experiments making use of NMR and MS techniques to identify, measure and quantify small molecules known as metabolites. MSIO covers metabolite profiling, targeted or undertargeted, tracer based applications. MSIO reuses a number of resources such as CHEBI, DUO, NMRCV, OBI, and STATO.	An ontology representation of the NCBI organismal taxonomy	The NCIt OBO Edition project aims to increase integration of the NCIt with OBO Library ontologies. NCIt is a reference terminology that includes broad coverage of the cancer domain, including cancer related diseases, findings and abnormalities. NCIt OBO Edition releases should be considered experimental.	Next Generation Biobanking Ontology (NGBO) is an open application ontology representing contextual data about omics digital assets in biobank. The ontology focuses on capturing the information about three main activities: wet bench analysis used to generate omics data, bioinformatics analysis used to analyze and interpret data, and data management.	An integrated ontology for the description of life-science and clinical investigations	An ontological version of MIABIS (Minimum Information About BIobank data Sharing)	Ontology to establish data exchange standards and common data elements in the microRNA (miR) domain.	The PRIDE PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE) database is a centralized, standards compliant, public data repository for proteomics data, including protein and peptide identifications, post-translational modifications and supporting spectral evidence.	A structured controlled vocabulary for sequence annotation, for the exchange of annotation data and for the description of sequence objects in databases.	STATO is the statistical methods ontology. It contains concepts and properties related to statistical methods, probability distributions and other concepts related to statistical analysis, including relationships to study designs and plots. 	Uberon is an integrated cross-species anatomy ontology representing a variety of entities classified according to traditional anatomical criteria such as structure, function and developmental lineage. The ontology includes comprehensive relationships to taxon-specific anatomical ontologies, allowing integration of functional, phenotype and expression data.

Investigation Title	16S rRNA sequencing of samples from universal stool bank donors.
Investigation Description	Universal stool banks provide stool to physicians for use in treating recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection via fecal microbiota transplantation. Stool donors providing the material are rigorously screened for diseases and disorders with a potential microbiome etiology, and they are likely healthier than the controls in most microbiome datasets. 16S rRNA sequencing was performed on samples from a selection of stool donors at a large stool bank, OpenBiome, to characterize their gut microbial community and to compare samples across different timepoints and sequencing runs.
